\usage{
ee_install_python_packages(method = c("auto", "virtualenv", "conda"),
  conda = "auto", ee_version = NULL, envname = NULL,
  conda_python_version = "3.7", quiet = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{Installation method. By default, "auto" automatically
finds a method that will work in the local environment. Change the
default to force a specific installation method. Note that the
"virtualenv" method is not available on Windows (as this isn't
supported by rgee). Note also that since this command runs
without privilege the "system" method is available only on Windows.}

\item{conda}{Path to conda executable (or "auto" to find conda
using the PATH and other conventional install locations).}

\item{ee_version}{earthengine-api version to install. When
this argument is NULL (the default), the version with which
rgee was built will be installed.}

\item{envname}{Name of Python environment, or full path, which Python
packages are to be installed.}

\item{conda_python_version}{the Python version installed in the
created conda environment. Python 3.7 is installed by default.}

\item{quiet}{logical. Suppress info message}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to \code{\link[reticulate:conda_install]{reticulate::conda_install()}} or
\code{\link[reticulate:virtualenv_install]{reticulate::virtualenv_install()}}.}
