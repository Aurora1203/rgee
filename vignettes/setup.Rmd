`rgee` has two types of dependencies: **the strict ones and the related with I/O** . The <span
style="color:#b52b09">**strict dependencies**</span> must be
satisfied before the `rgee` installation. If this is not fulfilled
**rgee just will not work**. The dependencies that comprised this group
are:

-   <span style="color:#b52b09"><b> Google account with Earth Engine
    activated </b></span>
-   <span style="color:#b52b09"><b> Python >= v3.5 </b></span>
-   <span style="color:#b52b09"><b> EarthEngine Python API (Python package) </b></span>

The activation of **Earth Engine accounts** depends on each user, check
the oficial website of [Google Earth
Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) for more details. If you do not
count with a **Python environment** in your system, run
`ee_Initialize()` to display an interactive menu to install
[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (a free
minimal installer for conda). We highly recommend use an virtual
environment to use `rgee`, you can create one using `ee_install_create_pyenv`.
Finally, the `ee_install_python_packages()` function is provided as a
convenient way to install all Python packages needed in `rgee`, even
though it is not mandatory. You can count on with your own custom
installation. This would be also allowed. All the step described before are
summarised below:

``` r
library(rgee)
# Recommended way to install external rgee dependencies 

# 1. Initialize rgee with ee_Initialize(). If there is no any
#    Python environment, miniconda will be installed by default.
ee_Initialize()

# 2. Create a Python environment, e.g. ee.
pyenv <- ee_install_create_pyenv(python_env = "ee")

# Find others Python environments in the system.
# ee_install_discover_pyenvs()

# 3. Set a Python environment (e.g. ee) and restart R to see changes.
ee_install_set_pyenv(pyenv, install = TRUE)

# 4. Install Python package dependencies and restart R to see changes.
ee_install_python_packages()

# 5. Initialize rgee again!
ee_Initialize()
```

By the other hand, the  <span style="color:#857e04"><b>I/O dependencies</b></span> unlock `rgee`
import & export functions. This dependencies are not mandatory. However,
many of the rgee I/O functionality depend on it. The dependencies that
comprised this group are shown below:

-   <span style="color:#857e04">**Google Cloud Storage
    credentials**</span>
-   <span style="color:#857e04">**Google Drive credentials**</span>

### Import and Export Spatial Data using rgee

The batch import/export involves difficulties for most GEE users. In
`rgee`, we are aware of it and we created several functions to help
users to download and upload spatial data. If you are trying to
**download** data from Earth Engine you will have three options:

-   **ee\_as\_sf**: Useful to download ee\$Geometry, ee\$Feature and ee\$FeatureCollection.
-   **ee\_as\_stars** or **ee\_as\_raster**: Convert ee$Image to stars and raster object.
-   **ee\_as\_thumbnail**: Create a raster or stars object based on a
    thumbnail image.

These functions through the argument **`via`** will permit you to
**change the download method**. There are three methods to download an
EE object: The first one (`getInfo`) fetch and return spatial objects directly,
the `drive` method use Google Drive (GD) as an intermediate
container, and finally `gcs` which use Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
`rgee` to deal with **GD** and **GCS** use the R package
[googledrive](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/) and
[googleCloudStorageR](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleCloudStorageR/)
respectively, so you will need to install it before.

``` r
# please try as follow
install.packages('googledrive')
install.packages('googleCloudStorageR')
```

**GD** is more friendly to novice Earth Engine users because the
authentication process could be done without leaving R. However, if you
are trying to move large amounts of data, is preferable use **GCS** instead. For using GCS, you will
need to have your own Google Project with a credit card added to the GCS service, charges will apply. See the
[GCS\_AUTH\_FILE](https://github.com/csaybar/GCS_AUTH_FILE.json)
tutorial to create your own service account key. If you want to
understand why this is necessary, please have a look [Mark
Edmondson](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleCloudStorageR/articles/googleCloudStorageR.html)
tutorial.

Batch **upload** is a harder process, in `rgee` we try to make it
simple. If you want to upload files in a batch way, firstly you must
**get authorization to read & write into a Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
bucket**. `rgee` implement three functions:

-   **sf\_as\_ee**: Convert a sfg, sfc or sf object to an ee$FeatureCollection.
-   **stars\_as\_ee**: Convert an stars object to an ee$Image.
-   **raster\_as\_ee**: Convert an raster object to an ee$Image.

### Authentication

`rgee` deal with three different Google APIâ€™s:

-   Google Earth Engine
-   Google Drive
-   Google Cloud Storage

To authenticate either Google Drive or Google Cloud Storage, you just
need to run as follow:

``` r
library(rgee)
#ee_reattach() # reattach ee as a reserve word

# Initialize just Earth Engine
ee_Initialize()
ee_Initialize(email = 'csaybar@gmail.com') # Use the argument email is not mandatory

# Initialize Earth Engine and GD
ee_Initialize(email = 'csaybar@gmail.com', drive = TRUE)

# Initialize Earth Engine and GCS
ee_Initialize(email = 'csaybar@gmail.com', gcs = TRUE)

# Initialize Earth Engine, GD and GCS
ee_Initialize(email = 'csaybar@gmail.com', drive = TRUE, gcs = TRUE)
```

If the Google account is verified and the permission is granted, you
will be directed to an authentication token. Copy this token and paste
it in the emerging GUI. Unlike Earth Engine and GD, GCS need to set up its credential manually ([link1](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleCloudStorageR/articles/googleCloudStorageR.html) and [link2](https://github.com/csaybar/GCS_AUTH_FILE.json)). In all cases, the credentials always will be stored in: 

``` r
ee_get_earthengine_path()
```
Remember you only have to authorize once, for next sessions it will not be necessary.

### Checking

The `ee_check()` function will help you for checking the sanity of your 
`rgee` installation and dependencies. 

-   `ee_check_python()` - Python version
-   `ee_check_credentials()` - Google Drive and GCS credentials
-   `ee_check_rgee_python_packages()` - Python packages


``` r
library(rgee)
ee_check()
```
